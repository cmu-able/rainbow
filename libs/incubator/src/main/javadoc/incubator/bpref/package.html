The <code>bpref</code> package allows mapping of beans to preferences (using
the <code>java.util.prefs</code> API). The package provides an API to save a
bean to a preferences node and to populate (load) a bean from a preferences
node.
</p> 
<p>
Beans' attributes are saved in a node using a prefix. This allows several
beans to coexist in the same node without preference key conflicts. The beans'
properties are mapped to preference keys and their values converted to strings
(all data saved in the preferences are strings).
