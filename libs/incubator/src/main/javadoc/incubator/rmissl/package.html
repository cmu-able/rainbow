This package contains an implementation of a server and client socket factories
over SSL for use with RMI. These classes will accept that the server certificate
is self-signed.
</p>

<p>
In order to use them, a certificate should be generated using
<code>keytool</code> (<code>keytool -genkey -alias &lt;name&gt; -keystore
&lt;file&gt;</code>).
</p>

<p>
Code was obtained from the JSSE examples and from
