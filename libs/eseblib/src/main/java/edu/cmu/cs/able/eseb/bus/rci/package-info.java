/**
<p>The <code>rci</code> package implements the <em>remote control
interface</em> of the event bus. The RCI allows obtaining information on the
event bus as well as some other basic operations such as modifying
block and unblock filters in the client's chains.</p>

<p>The remote interface is done using RMI
(see {@link edu.cmu.cs.able.eseb.bus.rci.EventBusRemoteControlInterface})
and using the <code>SyncScb</code> infrastructure.</p>
