/**
 * <p>
 * Class used to control running threads. A flag keeps a marker whether threads
 * should or not continue and keeps record of which threads have reached the
 * flag. It is essentially an implementation of a barrier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Using this class several threads may keep a synchronization point. Lets
 * suppose we have a process that divides into three phases, A, B and C and we
 * want several threads in parallel to execute phase A. We want all threads to
 * move to phase B when all have finished A. When all finish phase B we want all
 * to start phase C. In order to do this we create two flags, one representing
 * the end of phase A and the other the end of phase B. Each thread is now:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public void process(ThreadFlag flagA, ThreadFla flagB) {
 * 	doSomethingInPhazeA();
 * 	flagA.reach();
 * 	doSomethingInPhazeB();
 * 	flagB.reach();
 * 	doSomethingInPhazeC();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The method <code>reach</code> will block the current thread until someone
 * invokes the <code>allowContinue</code> method. So, if there were 20 threads
 * running, we could use a subclass of <code>ThreadFlag</code> to start all
 * threads into the next phase:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class MyStartAllAtOnceFlag extends ThreadFlag {
 * 	public int count = 0;
 * 
 * 	public void threadReached(List l) {
 * 		if (l.size() == 20) {
 * 			// All threads have arrived.
 * 			allowContinue();
 * 		}
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
