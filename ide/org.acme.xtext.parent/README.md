# Acme Xtext Language

This is a (not fully functional) definition of the Acme language for use in Rainbow.

One of the common models that Rainbow manipulates are architecture models expressed 
in Acme. Gauges, Commands, and other Rainbow definitions may therefore refrenced them 
by default.

In order to support the development of Gauges, Probes, Effectors, Model Factories this 
project contains a minimal implementation that enables checks of Rainbow specification. 
It is not intended to be a fully functional Acme editor.
