/**
 * This interface defines common strings and commands required for the Gauge Protocol.
 * <p>
 * There are eleven Gauge Protocol Actions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>CREATE - Creates a Gauge at a defined <em>location</em> of the given type and name, for the given model type and
 * name.<br>
 * This must be the initial protocol message for any Gauge, and the REPORT_CREATED message received before the other
 * actions make sense.
 * <li>REPORT_CREATED - A Gauge has been created, a <em>uid</em> is returned, with a <em>beacon period</em>.
 * <li>DELETE - Deletes a Gauge, destroying it.
 * <li>REPORT_DELETED - A Gauge has been deleted, no more report should come from it.
 * <li>CONFIGURE - Configures a Gauge of <em>uid</em> using a set of propertyName-propertyValue pairs.
 * <li>REPORT_CONFIGURED - A Gauge has been configured, with particular <em>uid</em>.
 * <li>SUBSCRIBE - Subcribe to a Gauge of a particular <em>uid</em> for a specified <em>duration</em>.
 * <li>UNSUBSCRIBE - Unsubscribe from a Gauge of a particular <em>uid</em>.<br>
 * After the specified subscription duration expires, unsubscription automatically occurs.
 * <li>ISSUE_COMMAND - A command representation issued by the gauge, with <em>uid</em>, <em>gauge-type</em>,
 * <em>gauge-name</em>, <em>model-type</em>, and <em>model-name</em>.
 * <li>ISSUE_COMMANDS - A list of commands (with values) issued by the Gauge, with <em>uid</em>, <em>gauge-type</em>,
 * <em>gauge-name</em>, <em>model-type</em>, and <em>model-name</em>.
 * <li>BEACON - A beacon of <em>uid</em>, <em>gauge-type</em>, <em>gauge-name</em>, <em>model-type</em>,
 * <em>model-name</em> is sent by the Gauge.<br>
 * If this message is not received within the beacon period, the Gauge is considered to have failed/died.
 * </ul>
