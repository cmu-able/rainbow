/**
 * Captures an abstract Rainbow model, for example a model of the architecture. A model in Rainbow should provide the

 * 
 * 1. A way to get a model instance keyed by some value (e.g., the filename) <br>
 * 2. A command factory that can be used to make changes to the model -- not sure what the abstract representation of a
 * command factory should be <br>
 * 3. Lock seeking methods for a model instance? <br>
 * 4. Get a snapshot of a model instance (a snapshot will not be updated by any changes through the command interface)
 * (p.s., this is needed at least by the tactic executor, which requires no changes to the model)
