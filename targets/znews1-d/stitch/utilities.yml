# Created September 5, 2006 (Shang-Wen Cheng)
#
# Utility curves, defined as X:Y pairs, where X is value of the dimension and Y
# is the utility in the range [0,1]
#
# History:
# - [SWC 2006.09.05] Created file, defined utilities for ZNews.
# - [SWC 2007.03.13] Added utility dimension to incorporate strategy failure history.

# Weighted utility preferences, each set should sum to 1.
# Three scenarios:
#   1.) Nominal request rate -> Sustained, peak request rate -> Nominal request rate
#   2.) Nominal request rate -> Transient, peak request rate -> Nominal request rate
#   3.) Any request rate -> Abnormally high request rate (e.g., Ramsey case) -> Any request rate
