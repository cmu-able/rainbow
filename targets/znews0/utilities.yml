# Weighted utility preferences, each set should sum to 1.
# Three scenarios:
#   a) Nominal request rate -> Sustained, peak request rate -> Nominal request rate
#   b) Nominal request rate -> Transient, peak request rate -> Nominal request rate
#   c) Any request rate -> Abnormally high request rate (e.g., Ramsey case) -> Any request rate
